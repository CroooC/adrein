            <h1>About Adrein</h1>
            <h3>Who I am?</h3>
            <p>Hello there!</p>
            <p>My name is Nobody, I am a young mechanical engineering student, and you are on my new website! Wwooww!!!</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>A little bit of history:</h3>
            <p>The first line of code programmed in this project was at the beginning of 2023. Then my time and most importantly my motivation to continue and grow the website has highly fluctuated. Till early August 2024, when the internet saw the first connection of my project under the name: adrein.pythonanywhere.com!!! Yes... being a student still isn't paid.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Wait?! What is all of this??</h3>
            <p>
                This is nothing serious... this website aims to train me and challenge me over programming projects and also show you what I can make and most important what I can't make...<br>
                What will you find here? Some mini-games, funny functionalities, strange web pages and more... I let you explore the rest on your own!<br>
                For now, this website is mainly coded in Python, HTML and CSS and a little bit of JS (because I don't know this language yet)
            </p>

                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>What next?! A Roadmap...</h3>
            <p>
                I have a few ideas that can be implemented in the project like some videogames that I made 100% in Python, or a fun/small encrypting/decrypting app and other small Python projects but it's still hard for me to adapt Pyhton to a web solution...<br>
                I don't forget that in the actual status, the website is really not finished! And a lot more finishing is needed! Like for the contact page, the loading page, the header/nav menu, some games, functionalities and apps that have really poor content...<br>
                And I have new big projects that will maybe arrive on this website!
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>To conclude, don't hesitate to write to me if you have some suggestions or ideas about this website, mini-games, webpages, problems, bugs,...</p>
            <br>
            <p>Have fun!!!</p>
